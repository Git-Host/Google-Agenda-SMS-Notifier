# jQbrick

`jQbrick` is a **components library** I like do define _"Bricks for Mobile App Directors"_.  
It is build over _jQuery_, _BackboneJS_ and uses _jQueryMobile_ as UI toolkit to produce well structured Mobile Apps.

_RequireJS_ is the glue between all blocks and allow to optimize your Application in production stage.


## Where "jQbrick" cames from?
`jQbrick` comes from a `jQMBR` reengineering process.  
The name is a mix of "bricks" to highlight the **components library** nature of this project.

You speak "jQubrick" as "jay" + "Kubrick" (the American film director).  
I like to refer to a very important film director because - in my intention - **you will use
`jQbrick` components as actors in you Mobile Application**.
